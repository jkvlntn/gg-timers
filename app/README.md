# Web Client

## Usage

### `npm install`
Installs the required dependencies

### `npm start`
Run the app in dev

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for deployment

## Development API URL
Create a file named `.env.development` in the app directory.

Add the following line to the file, using the address of the server: `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000`

This is only needed when using the app in dev because the built app is statically served.
